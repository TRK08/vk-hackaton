It&#x27;s better and cheaper than what you can get in the market.You are allowed to supplement -- this may or may not make sense, but your final coverage will be a lot cheaper if you start with employer insurance.", "score": 4}, {"text": "As someone who moved from the UK to US under almost identical conditions, let me say this: If you have a job that offers health insurance 99% of the time you will be better off taking that health insurance rather than buying it directly from the exchanges.Why? At least two reasons:1. Employers are in a stronger negotiating position as insurance companies really fight for the business (it is for multiple people, so even if each one is less profitable the entire account will be more profitable with less overhead, so they WANT it).2. The people buying directly from exchanges are higher risk&#x2F;greater cost. They&#x27;re normally poorer, self employed (which includes a lot of people in physically demanding professions as well, who get injured often), and some are early retirees (pre-medicare age, but still &quot;older&quot;).Plus the biggest reason is that almost all employers pay a % of your health insurance premium. If you go with the exchange you&#x27;re paying 100% (of a higher base) rather than 70% of a lower one. So unless your employer has simply terrible health insurance, it is almost never a better idea from a financial perspective to go private.If you&#x27;re really paranoid about it, just take the employer health insurance, assuming they pay 30% and you pay 70% of the premium, take an equivalent amount out of your pay and save it (e.g. save 30% of the premium a month). Since that is what you would have been paying privately anyway (100%), now you&#x27;re just using the employer&#x27;s cut to save for a rainy day.Personally if it was up to me employer provided health insurance should be banned in the US and everyone (aside from the US Military) should be required to go out and get private coverage (e.g. car insurance). That way the prices come down, competition goes up, and certain demographics (unemployed, self-employed, early retirees, etc) aren&#x27;t unfairly &quot;punished.&quot;But I don&#x27;t see that happening any time soon (or ever) because employer provided health insurance is too heavily ingrained in US culture.

It is regularly reported that new drugs which are typically priced around US$120k per year (for multiple years in some cases) are not cost effective. Case in point: crizotonib. This is a drug that works very well at shrinking tumours and controlling disease in incurable lung cancer. It is targeted - it only works if your tumour has a particular gene fusion, which occurs in about 4% of lung cancer patients. It is well tolerated compared to chemotherapy. It&#x27;s the kind of personalised medicine we are hoping to achieve more broadly in the future. And the way it is priced isn&#x27;t cost effective [1].I can guarantee you that the coming surge in immunotherapies will be exorbitantly priced. And these are drugs we will be giving not to 4% of cancer patients, but &gt; 50% of advanced cancer patients in a given tumour type.These problems are even worse in countries where the government pays for drugs, because they are far more restricted in what they can afford. Patients just end up missing out. And if you think having cancer is bad enough, knowing there is a drug that might help and not being able to afford it is just heart breaking.So good luck to them, I hope they can draw some money away from nonsense like crowd funding potato salad.[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jco.ascopubs.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;24&#x2F;JCO.2013.53...", "score": 0}]},

I suppose one attempt at fixing this could be to separate out the function parsing code into its own function, one which can&#x27;t ever cause execution of its input, and use that to parse function definitions in environment variables. This would be a pretty easy and elegant thing to do with a recursive-descent parser, but bash uses a lex&#x2F;yacc-generated one to consume an entire command at once...However, all in all I&#x27;m not so sure this ability to export funcdefs is such a good idea - forking a subshell automatically inherits the functions in the parent, and if it&#x27;s a shell that wasn&#x27;t created in such a manner, if it needs function definitions it can read them itself from some other source. This &quot;feature&quot; also means environment variables cannot start with the string &#x27;() {&#x27; (and exactly the string &#x27;() {&#x27; - even removing the space between those characters, e.g. &#x27;(){&#x27;, doesn&#x27;t trigger it) without causing an error in any subprocess - violating the usual assumption that environment variables can hold any arbitrary string.

Well it does save cash :) I only consider it recreation when I have friends over. The main reason, however, because it&#x27;s normal. Probably a cultural thing (not judging!). In the Netherlands (or at least in my circles), it&#x27;d be considered &quot;weird&quot; if you eat out (or takeout) more than once or twice a week. It&#x27;s just considered normal that people cook, like doing laundry. Also means it&#x27;s not going to be fancy always, sometimes it&#x27;s just fuel and nutrients (some&#x2F;any combo of vegetables, proteins and carbs). I also believe it&#x27;s more expensive to eat out than in the US, relative to cooking from basic ingredients (or maybe vegetables are cheaper, I dunno). I can make tasty dinner for about \u20ac5-7 (two portions). Getting something healthy readymade for you is at least \u20ac10 (one portion).(2. planning) Remember that article a while back about &quot;people sized cities&quot; (or something like that)? In NL, if you live in a medium-size town, a supermarket is never farther away than a 5 minute bicycle ride. My closest one is less than 200m, the next (bigger) one is 700m. But I&#x27;m lucky :) There are people that do weekly shopping of course, usually either big families or people that live out in the country, where the nearest supermarket is a cardrive away (like in the US).\nBesides shopping-planning, if I cook for myself, I usually make at least two-three portions because it&#x27;s really the same amount of work as making one. Also you can&#x27;t buy many kinds of fresh ingredients in single-meal amounts. So I do need to plan ahead to be able to eat all that stuff before it goes bad. Sometimes that means having weird dinner-type things for breakfast. I hate throwing food away, but I try not to be too hard on myself if it means I ate healthy stuff, but messed up on the planning.(3. what do I cook) Everything. My staple go-to meals, however are some kind of pasta-vegetable-salad (fusili pasta, cherry tomatoes, any kind of salad vegetables, cucumber, paprika, shallots, etc, any cheese, salami, bacon, eggs, olives etc whatever I have in the fridge + dressing from mayo+mustard+honey) and broccoli + fried tempeh or organic sausages. Also, brussel sprouts. These last two vegetables seem (for me) to cover most nutrients I&#x27;ve been missing when I feel I haven&#x27;t been eating healthy. At least I feel better immediately :)I also love cooking weird and&#x2F;or special stuff. I could write a whole series of posts on that. And I did, but the stories&#x2F;pictures are spread over many different parts and ages of the Internet.(4. diet) Not really. I did paleo&#x2F;keto for a while, twice, it was fun, tasty and really interesting to find your body can go into a different &quot;mode&quot; (ketosis) for energy. However I found that my physical condition for running improved a great deal when I added more carbs to my diet. I probably did something wrong, cause many people seem to be able to do sports just fine on keto diets. Anyway, these days I just don&#x27;t eat a lot of carbs. I find I have to pay attention to eating enough (sorry I&#x27;m probably weird), both calorie-wise and nutrients (as I said, broccoli&#x2F;sprouts).(5. hacks and tips) I have zillions. Get a good knife. Learn how to use your microwave effectively (it cooks broccoli and many other things to perfection, if you know how--I&#x27;ll explain if asked). Dishwashing machine. Check out the kitchen-tools section in shops every now and then, see if there&#x27;s any tools that may make your particular way of cooking easier. If you don&#x27;t have bbq tongs, get them, even if you&#x27;re vegetarian. Fresh ginger keeps for a long time in the freezer. Get to know the chemistry behind cooking, preparing food, nutrition, etc. Watch Alton Brown&#x27;s series Good Eats, it&#x27;ll not only teach you loads of basic cooking techniques, but also the how &amp; why behind these techniques, and even the chemistry&#x2F;science of it. Plus it&#x27;s entertaining. Just pick some random episodes on topics you think are interesting. I guarantee you&#x27;ll learn something useful from every one of them.

Do you plan ahead? Like a weekly meal plan?I tried to do a weekly plan, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I like to buy groceries for 2 days at a time, at most, and I enjoy the trip to the store to see what&#x27;s looking good and inspires me.The only real planning I do is to keep a well organized list of posts and recipes in Evernote that I want to try at some point.3.

In the cooler months I love making a universal broth for ramen, braising greens ,etc and have it on hand for a couple days.

Do you have any life hacks, tips to be more productive as a cook?Just like exercise, reading, social time, it&#x27;s all about how you prioritize. Cooking can be a quick 10 minutes to make a simple frittata, or several hours for something more elaborate on a weekend.Personally, if I&#x27;m working from home, I schedule a break to start cooking dinner in the afternoon. And I usually cook enough to have leftovers to play with for another day or two.
